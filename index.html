  <h1>HelioClock Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: August 8, 2025</small></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how HelioClock (‚Äúthe App‚Äù) handles information when you use it.
    We designed HelioClock to collect as little data as possible while providing sunrise, sunset, solar timing, and weather features.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No account required. We don‚Äôt ask you to sign up.</li>
    <li>No ads. No data selling. No third-party advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li>Location is used to show sun and weather info and is not stored on our servers.</li>
    <li>We call third-party APIs (e.g., weather and reverse geocoding) to fetch data for the coordinates you select.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Information We Process</h2>
  <h3>Location (precise or approximate)</h3>
  <p>
    With your permission, the App accesses your device‚Äôs location to compute sun times, azimuth/elevation, and to fetch local weather.
    The coordinates are processed on-device and may be sent to third-party APIs (listed below) solely to return weather and place names.
    We do not persist your location on any server controlled by us.
  </p>

  <h3>Favorites & settings</h3>
  <p>
    If you save favorite locations or preferences, they are stored locally on your device (and, if you use platform backups, via Apple‚Äôs iCloud backup under your control).
  </p>

  <h3>Crash/diagnostic data</h3>
  <p>
    The App does not intentionally collect analytics or diagnostics beyond what Apple may provide to developers in aggregate (if you have opted in at the OS level).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>To provide core functionality, the App may query these services with the coordinates you choose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong> ‚Äî weather and solar data APIs (<a href="https://open-meteo.com/">open-meteo.com</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>OpenCage</strong> or <strong>Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)</strong> ‚Äî reverse geocoding to display place names (<a href="https://opencagedata.com/">opencagedata.com</a>, <a href="https://nominatim.org/">nominatim.org</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services receive coordinates and return weather/place information. Please review their policies for details on how they handle requests.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide app features: sun times, golden/blue hour, azimuth/elevation, weather, and place names.</li>
    <li>Improve reliability and safety (e.g., basic crash info provided by Apple, if enabled).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Don‚Äôt Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No selling of personal data.</li>
    <li>No targeted advertising or tracking across apps/sites.</li>
    <li>No server-side profiles of users.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store your personal data on our servers. Location lookups are transient. Favorites and settings remain on your device until you delete the app or clear data.
  </p>

  <h2>Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is rated 4+ and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>International Use</h2>
  <p>
    Third-party API servers may be located in various regions. By using the App, you consent to the processing of data in those regions solely for returning results to your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>
    For users in the EEA/UK, we process location data with your consent (to provide location-based features) and legitimate interests (to operate and secure the App).
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not maintain user accounts or store personal data on our servers, requests to access, correct, or delete data typically involve data on your device (e.g., removing favorites or uninstalling the App).
    For questions, contact us at the email below.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use industry-standard transport encryption (HTTPS) for all API requests. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we strive to use reasonable safeguards.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date above and, when appropriate, notify you in the App.
  </p>
